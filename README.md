**2D Stellaris**

_Project Goals_

I'll let horus fill this one out.

Project Manager:
@miad2401

Designers:
@nov4marine
@miad2401

How to get up dev env:
1. Install python 3
2. Install Pygame-ce
3. Install Pygame_gui

You should be able to run it now.

How to run:
1. Make sure you have all dependencies installed
2. Open terminal and use command "python mygame.py"

**Disclaimer**: Horus doesn't know how to code, so he uses AI. As such, this project does use AI.
